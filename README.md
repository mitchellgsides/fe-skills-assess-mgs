## Front End Skills Assessment Comments

Time to Complete:

- I took approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes to finish the coding portion of the assignment. I used my normal work process including code completion and AI coding tools.

What I didn't Finish or Would work on More:

1. A bit more responsive for small screens (less than 530px).
2. Scroll handling including scrolling the list of images instead of the whole page, and load more for large numbers of images, or an infinite scroll.
3. Perhaps caching for the images and some better validation.
4. Theming improvements and consistency.
5. Implement an Error Boundary to handle
